But I didn't have time to finish the whole thing, but I still did a part of the back end.

## 7 -Entity Relationship Diagram - Simple Order Manager

In ERD, in addition to having the basic entities.
I created other entities that would be necessary for the understanding and functioning of the database.

The ERD image has the sales_product entity that was created because 
the relationship between product and order was too much for many. 
That's why this entity was created.
